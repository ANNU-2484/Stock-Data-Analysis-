>This dashboard helps us understand how the stock is performing. We can see when the price went up or down, and how many people were buying or selling each day.
Big changes in price or high trading volumes may be linked to news or important events. The difference between the highest and lowest price in the year shows that the stock can move a lot.
Overall, this helps us spot trends, understand investor behavior, and make better decisions based on real dataâ€”not guesses.
